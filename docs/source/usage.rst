Building a Query
----------------

To use the Query Builder simply type or copy and paste the text you would like to run a search query for and the following content will be provided in the Interface:

   A table that breaks down each set of characters separated by a space (i.e., Elements) in the user input that includes: 
      1.  a **Replacement View** section with a vertical breakdown of the characters and the corresponding pattern matching that will be applied
      2.  Editable pattern matching syntax that can be modified to the user's preference that contains validation if the edits continue to match the original input or if they no longer match the original input

   A Field Selection section where the User can designate the Field Tags to be added to the search queries.  Currently the Field Selection is limited to specific Term Fields with the option to include an addition Field Query for Live/Dead Status

   A table that creates an entire search strategy based on your Input, Edits to pattern-matching, and Field Selections.
